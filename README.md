Module 6 Challenge

WeatherPy.ipynb: Use OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data for 500+ random cities and create scatter plots and linear regression plots to investigate the relationships and trends in the data. 

VacationPy.ipynb: Use the hvPlot API to create interactive maps that show the cities on the map with markers sized by their humidity. Then narrow down the cities being displayed based on your preferences and use the geoapify API to find a hotel within 10,000 meters of each cityâ€™s longitude and latitude and then use the hvPlot API again to add the Hotel to the hover display for each city on the map.
